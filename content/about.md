### About the Website
This website was built for the University of Washington's incoming [Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics Institute (CHOICE)](https://sop.washington.edu/choice/) PhD and MS students. The goal of this website is to provide an overview on the core of R programming to jumpstart their ability to use data in a meaningful way.  
  
The workshop, as it stands, is meant to span three days. So, the tutorials and problem sets are meant to cover basics. Due to brevity, we may sometimes skip over some fairly useful things to know. I will provide some helpful documents in class and below for those that want to go more in depth!  
  
### Useful Documents for Further Learning
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is kind of like the Bible for introductory R. So, I would highly recommend it.  
  
[The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/) is... not that helpful for new beginners. But, like any other language, R has its nuances. The R inferno is appropriately named as it tries to untangle some less-common issues that advanced R users might run into.  
  
[Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html), like R for Data Science, is written by the Godfather of R programming - Hadley Wickham. This book describes some advanced features in R that we will not be covering in our intro course. Frankly, a lot of the book seems more relevant to CS majors needed to **create** things in R, rather than simply use it to answer questions. Still, may be worth checking out for solutions to your more advanced needs!
