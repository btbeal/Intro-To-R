      <description>In the previous lesson we covered the very basics of R. We discussed that R can be a fancy calculator, interpret logical arguments, and some fun facts sprinkled throughout. In addition, we covered basic data types and structures. Alone, this is good information to know... and is indeed the very bare bones introduction... but we are here to look at data - to manipulate data in a meaningful way. The first step towards data exploration is learning how to find values in a data set.</description>

      <description>Welcome to The University of Washington and your crash course on R. Note that this class will not be incredibly robust (we have three days) but it will aim to provide you the tools necessary to do well in your stats classes and beyond. Futher, I believe several of you will take a semester long course in R. You&#39;ll be ahead of that game but will go into more depth during that class.</description>
