```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

gapminder_IncomePerCap <- read.csv2("../data/income_per_person.csv", sep = ",")
```

For this lesson, we're going to use the gapminder data, which can be found in its original form  [here](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). If you're reading this and not attending the class, I would highly encourage you to check out the website! The late Hans Rosling was a brilliant guy and his work, followed up by children, is worth digging through.\
\
There are two sets of data I want to focus on. The first is simply population data. Download the data by clicking [this link](../data/income_per_person.csv).\
\
```{r}
head(gapminder_IncomePerCap)
```
