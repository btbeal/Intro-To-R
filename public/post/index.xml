      <description>Welcome to The University of Washington and your crash course on R. Note that this class will not be incredibly robust (we have three days) but it will aim to provide you the tools necessary to do well in your stats classes and beyond. Futher, I believe several of you will take a semester long course in R. You&#39;ll be ahead of that game but will go into more depth during that class.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
